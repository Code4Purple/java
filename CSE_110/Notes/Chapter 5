# Basic Programs Idea
    Input -> Processing -> Output
    We can take user input -> do some Processing to it -> give the output to the user.

    ** Goals: **
        Generalization
        Abstraction
        Maintainability
        
    ## Your code should have all the code...
        All declarations in the same area of code 
        All of the Processing of the data in an area
        All of the Outputs should be in the same area of code 
        ** So the Programmer that is you or another can easily edit and upgrade code later **
