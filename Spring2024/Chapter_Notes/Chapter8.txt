Loop basics

A loop is a program construct that repeatedly executes the loop's statements (known as the loop body) while the loop's 
expression is true; when the expression is false, execution proceeds past the loop. Each time through a loop's statements 
is called an iteration

While loop: Basics

A while loop is a program construct that repeatedly executes a list of sub-statements (known as the loop body) while the loop's 
expression evaluates to true. Each execution of the loop body is called an iteration. Once entering the loop body, execution continues 
to the body's end, even if the expression would become false midway through.


Common errors

A common error is to use the opposite loop expression than desired, like using x == 0 rather than x != 0. 
Programmers should remember that the expression describes when the loop should iterate, not when the loop should terminate.

An infinite loop is a loop that never stops iterating. A common error is to accidentally create an infinite loop, often by forgetting to 
update a variable in the body, or by creating a loop expression whose evaluation to false isn't always reachable.

Basics

A loop commonly must iterate a specific number of times, such as 10 times. Though achievable with a while loop, 
that situation is so common that a special kind of loop exists. A for loop is a loop with three parts at the 
top: a loop variable initialization, a loop expression, and a loop variable update. 
A for loop describes iterating a specific number of times more naturally than a while loop.

The statement i = i + 1 is so common that the language supports the shorthand ++i, 
with ++ known as the increment operator. (Likewise, -- is the decrement operator, --i means i = i - 1).
As such, a standard way to loop N times is shown below.

for 	Number of iterations is computable before the loop, like iterating N times.

while 	Number of iterations is not (easily) computable before the loop, like iterating until the input is 
        'q'.

        Loop style issues
--------------------------------------
Starting with 0
        Programmers in C, C++, Java, and other languages have generally standardized on looping N times by starting 
        with i = 0 and checking for i < N, rather than by using i = 1 and i <= N. One reason is due to other constructs 
        (arrays / vectors), often used with loops, start with 0. Another is simply that a choice was made.

The ++ operators
        The ++ operator can appear as ++i (prefix form) or as i++ (postfix form). ++i increments i first and then 
        evaluates the result, while i++ evaluates the result first and then increments i. 
        The distinction is relevant in a statement like x = ++i vs. x = i++; if i is 5, the first yields x = 6, 
        the second x = 5.

        Some consider ++i safer for beginners in case they type i = ++i, which typically works as expected 
        (whereas i = i++ does not), so this material uses ++i throughout. The -- operator also has prefix and '
        ostfix versions. Incidentally, the C++ programming language gets its name from the ++ operator, 
        suggesting C++ is an increment or improvement over its C language predecessor.

In-loop declaration of i
        Variables can be declared throughout code, so many programmers use: for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i). But, the teaching experience of this material's authors suggests such declarations may confuse learners who may declare variables within loops, repeatedly re-declaring variables, etc. This material avoids the in-loop declaration approach. The authors hope to make the learning less error-prone, and have confidence that programmers can easily pick up on the common in-loop declaration approach later.

A nested loop is a loop that appears in the body of another loop. The nested loops are commonly referred to as the inner loop and outer loop.
Nested loops have various uses. One use is to generate all combinations of some items. For example, the following program generates all two-letter .com Internet domain names.

A continue statement in a loop causes an immediate jump to the loop condition check. 
A continue statement can sometimes improve the readability of a loop.

        Scope of names
-----------------------------------------
A declared name is only valid within a region of code known as the name's scope. 
Ex: A variable userNum declared in main() is only valid within main(), from the declaration to main()'s end.

Most of this material declares variables at the top of main() (and if the reader has studied methods, 
at the top of other methods). However, a variable may be declared within other blocks too. 
A block is a brace-enclosed {...} sequence of statements, such as found with an if-else, for loop, 
or while loop. A variable name's scope extends from the declaration to the closing brace }.

The program declares a new enumeration type named LightState. The program then declares a new variable lightVal of that type. The loop updates lightVal based on the user's input.

The example illustrates the idea of a state machine that is sometimes used in programs, especially programs that interact with physical objects, wherein the program moves among particular situations ("states") depending on input; see What is: State machine.

A programmer must include both the enumeration type and the enumerator within that type, as in lightVal = LightState.RED;. A common error is to omit the enumeration type in an expression. For example, the statement lightVal = RED; results in a compilation error.

Different enumerated types may use some of the same enumerators. For example, the above program might also declare public enum Warnings {GREEN, ORANGE, RED}. The enumeration values are then accessed as Warnings.RED and LightState.RED.

One might ask why the light variable wasn't simply declared as a string, and then compared with strings "GREEN", "RED", and "YELLOW". Enumerations are safer. If using a string, an assignment like light = "ORANGE" would not yield a compiler error, even though ORANGE is not a valid light color. Likewise, light == "YELOW" would not yield a compiler error, even though YELLOW is misspelled.

One could instead declare final variables for strings like final String LS_GREEN = "GREEN"; or even integer values like final int LS_GREEN = 0; and then use those constants in the code, but an enumeration is clearer, requires less code, and is less prone to error.
