Some programs require math operations beyond +, -, *, /, like computing a square root. 
A standard Math class has about 30 math operations, known as methods. The Math class is part of Java's 
standard language package, so no import is required.

A method is a list of statements executed by invoking the method's name, such invoking is known as a 
method call. Any method input values, or arguments, appear within ( ), separated by commas if more than one. 
A programmer must precede the method name with Math. to call a Math class method.

Method      Behavior                Example
sqrt(x)     square root of x        Math.sqrt(9.0)     evaluates to 3.0
pow(x, y)   Power: x^y              Math.pow(6.0, 2.0) evaluates to 36.0
abs(x)      Absolute value of x     MAth.abs(-99.5)    evaluates to 99.5


Division: Integer rounding
    When the operands of / are integers, the operator performs integer division, which does not generate 
    any fraction.
