An if statement executes a group of statements if an expression is true. 
Braces surround the if branch's statements. Braces { }, sometimes redundantly called curly braces, 
represent a grouping, such as a grouping of statements. Note: { } are braces, [ ] are brackets.

The example below uses ==. The equality operator (==) evaluates to true if the left and right sides are equal. 
Ex: If numYears is 50, then numYears == 50 evaluates to true. Note the equality operator is ==, not =.

Equality and inequality operators

Whereas the equality operator checks whether two values are equal, the inequality operator (!=) 
evaluates to true if the left and right sides are not equal, or different.

An expression involving the equality or inequality operators evaluates to a Boolean value. 
A Boolean is a type that has just two values: true or false.
