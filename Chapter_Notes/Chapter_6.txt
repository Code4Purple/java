An if statement executes a group of statements if an expression is true. 
Braces surround the if branch's statements. Braces { }, sometimes redundantly called curly braces, 
represent a grouping, such as a grouping of statements. Note: { } are braces, [ ] are brackets.

The example below uses ==. The equality operator (==) evaluates to true if the left and right sides are equal. 
Ex: If numYears is 50, then numYears == 50 evaluates to true. Note the equality operator is ==, not =.

Equality and inequality operators

Whereas the equality operator checks whether two values are equal, the inequality operator (!=) 
evaluates to true if the left and right sides are not equal, or different.

An expression involving the equality or inequality operators evaluates to a Boolean value. 
A Boolean is a type that has just two values: true or false.

    Logical operator 	            Description
a AND b 	                Logical AND: true when both of its operands are true.
a OR b 	                    Logical OR: true when at least one of its two operands are true.
NOT a 	                    Logical NOT: true when its one operand is false, and vice-versa.

AND -> &&
OR  -> ||
!A  -> !
