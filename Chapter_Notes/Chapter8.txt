Loop basics

A loop is a program construct that repeatedly executes the loop's statements (known as the loop body) while the loop's 
expression is true; when the expression is false, execution proceeds past the loop. Each time through a loop's statements 
is called an iteration

While loop: Basics

A while loop is a program construct that repeatedly executes a list of sub-statements (known as the loop body) while the loop's 
expression evaluates to true. Each execution of the loop body is called an iteration. Once entering the loop body, execution continues 
to the body's end, even if the expression would become false midway through.


Common errors

A common error is to use the opposite loop expression than desired, like using x == 0 rather than x != 0. 
Programmers should remember that the expression describes when the loop should iterate, not when the loop should terminate.

An infinite loop is a loop that never stops iterating. A common error is to accidentally create an infinite loop, often by forgetting to 
update a variable in the body, or by creating a loop expression whose evaluation to false isn't always reachable.
