An array is an ordered collection of variables (called elements). 
Each variable in the array (each element) has the same data type and the same name. 
Individual elements (variables) of the array are accessed by an integer index number, 
indicating their position in the array - relative to the first array element which is 
at index 0.

To summarize, an array is a

    set of variables (elements)
    with same name
    and same data type
    all located contiguously in memory (providing very fast access)
    each element is accessed by an integer index

Arrays allow us to create a specified number of variables (all of the same data type) 
with a single declaration and initialization statement.

Each element in an array is a variable.

When we create (instantiate) an array object, we must specify the data type and the number of elements that we want. 
The standard way to instantiate (create) an array object has these 4 parts: new <dataType>[<arraySize>]
  	  	 
1 - 	new 	- keyword telling Java that you want to create a new object in memory
2 - 	<dataType> 	- the data type of the elements
3 - 	[ ] 	- square brackets
4 - 	<arraySize> 	- the number of elements you want
  		

Here is an example instantiating an array of 5 int variables.

new int[5]

And here is an example that declares and creates an array of 5 int variables named sample.

int[] samples = new int[5];

example : dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[numElements];
