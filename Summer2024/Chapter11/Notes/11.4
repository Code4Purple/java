Primitive and Reference Types

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Wrapper classes

Java variables are one of two types.

    A primitive type variable directly stores the data for that variable type, such as int, double, or char. 
	Ex: int numStudents = 20; declares an int that directly stores the data 20.
    
    A reference type variable can refer to an instance of a class, also known as an object.

Java provides several wrapper classes that are built-in reference types that augment the primitive types. The Integer data type is a built-in class in Java that augments the int primitive type. Ex: Integer maxPlayers = 10; declares an Integer reference variable named maxPlayers that refers to an instance of the Integer class, also known as an Integer object. That Integer object stores the integer value 10.
