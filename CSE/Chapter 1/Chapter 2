    Unicode Examples : Braille, Musical Notation, Geometric shapes, Emoticons.

Data Types
    is way to encode some type of value so that the computer can mainpulate it (using 1s and 0s - Binary Numbers)
        Common data types 
            Boolean - true or false statements
            Ingteger - 14
            Floating point - 3.14
            String - tex 



----------Java's primitive data types----------------
    bytes - Integers (whole numbers) range -128 to 128
    short - Integers range of -32,768 to 32,767
    int  - Integers range of -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647
    long - Integers in the range of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to +9,223,372,036,854,775,807
    float - Real numbers in the range of ±3.40282347 x 1038 to 1.40239846 x 10-45
    double - Real numbers in the range of ±3.40282347 x 1038 to 1.40239846 x 10-45
    char - Any single character
    boolean - Only two values: true and false

Type    Size    range

In general use -> Integers are used for whole numbers 
               -> Double are used for real numbers

** Java String is not a Java primitive type **

Expressions will always evaluate to a value.

        Literal Expressions
Data Types      Literal Examples
int             -1 , 0 , 99
float           123.44f, -3f , 0.0f
double          123.123 , -3.0 , 0.0
String          "Hello!",   "Hi" , "123"
boolean         true(1), false(0) 

Compound Expressions - will always evaluate according to order of operations
    Operation               Operator
Parentheses                   ()
Multiplication & Divison    * , /
Addition & Subtraction      + , -

                String Escape Sequences
    Escape Sequences        What it represents
        \n                      a Newline ( or Return) character
        \t                      a tab character
        \"                      it allows the double Quote mark within the console print out -> "Hello"
        \'                      it allows the singal Quote mark within the console print out -> 'Hello'
        \\                      it allows the backlash within the console output -> /Hello

        Operation               Java Operator
        Addition                     +
        Subtraction                  -
        Multiplication               *
        Division                     /
        Modulus (Remainder)          %

Operators are instructions that can tell the computer to do some work.
The Operators are use in expressions typically made of two operands, one operator that gives an output; 3 + 5 = 8

Integer Division - an int divided by and int will always give an int result in Java.

Compound Expressions - are expressions composed of sub-expressions
Expression - are list of intructions for the computer to follow to compute a value
Concatenation - is building longer Strings out of shorter Strings.

# 2.7 Type Casting
Java cannot perform operations with operands of different types.

Narrowing Cast : will convert data from a data type with a wider range of valid values to a data type with a narrower range of valid values. Narrowing casts include the following:

            From Type   |   To Type
            double          float
            double          int 
            float           int

Implicit Cast :
Java will automatically cast a value of a narrower type to an equivalent value of a wider type.

To explicitly cast a value from one data type to another we use the following syntactic form:
(<dataTypeToCastTo>)valueToCast ; (int)3.0 
-> You can also get different outputs for values that you need more of scope ; float(3.145 * 3.56 * 56.6777)

# 2.8 Converting Data Types
Cast Operations & Parse Methods are expressions, and expressions always evaluated to a value.

# 2.9.1 
    Basic java code setup
        FILENAME : main.java
        FILENAME : Contents (below)

        class main {
            public static void main(string[] arg){
                **Code Geos here**
            }
        }

NOTED : Class names come from the savefiled so your able to run & complie the code

# 2.10

Variable Name : is just an item name.
Assignment : is the process of taking the variable name and giving it a value ; x = 5 -> Note : the equals sign(=) is what deos the assignment process.

    Vaiable name      |     Assignment Sign |       Value
       int x                     =                    5

Incrementing the Value : x = x + 1; 


# 2.11

Variable Declaration : is a statement that declares a new variable, specifying the variable's name and type. ; int dogs -> Note: Capitalization matters, so dogs is not the same as Dogs.

import java.util.Scanner; -> Imported Library to take Input data from the keyboard input
